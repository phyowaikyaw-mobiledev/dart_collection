/* - Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Dart has built-in collections:
   - Variable can hold only single value.
   - We need techniques that can hold more than one value So Let's use Data Structure.
   - Dart data structures are built-in language features, not a library or framework.

     Built-in Collections / Core Collections
     Part of Dart's core language
     Available without importing anything
   - Dart Collections Library (for advanced features)
     When you need extra functionality, import dart:collection:

  - Dart has built-in data structures
  - Dart's core collections
  - Using the dart:collection library for advanced structures

   - Data structures like List, Map, Set are built-in language features.
     The dart:collection is a library that extends these with more specialized structures.
